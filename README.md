# odin-recipes
My first html project repo
In this project I will be demonstrating knowledge and execution of html elements and attributes to create a website with recipe pages and publish it on GitHub.
At the end of this project I would have created a boilerplate HTML for the index page and two recipe pages, applied headings, created lists and use absolute and relative links to link my web pages. Pictures and/or video will be added to my web pages as well to make my pages visually appealing.
I would also demonstrate how I publish my work on GitHub by commiting my progress every step of the way in order to capture a history log or snapshots of the various stages of my work.
